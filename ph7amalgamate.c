/* This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from PH7 version 2.1.
 * By combining all the individual C code files into this single large file, the entire code
 * can be compiled as a single translation unit.This allows many compilers to do optimization's
 * that would not be possible if the files were compiled separately.Performance improvements
 * are commonly seen when PH7 is compiled as a single translation unit.
 *
 * This file is all you need to compile PH7.To use PH7 in other programs, you need
 * this file and the "ph7.h" header file that defines the programming interface to the 
 * PH7 engine.(If you do not have the "ph7.h" header file at hand, you will find
 * a copy embedded within the text of this file.Search for "Header file: <ph7.h>" to find
 * the start of the embedded ph7.h header file.) Additional code files may be needed if
 * you want a wrapper to interface PH7 with your choice of programming language.
 * To get the official documentation,please visit http://ph7.symisc.net/
